If a project is renamed, the error "resource is out of sync with the file 
system" appears when performing particular operations such as renaming again or
exporting the project. This is due to an Eclipse bug.

Ref: Bug 415531 - Refresh Policy resources not tracked through rename.
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=415531

Here is the procedure to avoid this issue when renaming a project:

- Right click on project
- Click "Rename..."
- Enter new name
- Right click on project
- Click "Properties"
- Click on "C/C++ Build"
- Select "Refresh Policy" tab
- Delete the resource with the old name
- Click "Add Resource..." and select the folder with the name of your project
- Click "Apply and close"
